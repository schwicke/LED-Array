# LEDband driver software
This software is kind of a hello-world example. It would display a text by scrolling the text in.

## Fonts
The display needs 8x8 pixel bitmap fonts. A sample font file (public domain) can be found here:

Some more fonts can be found on the internet. They are not included here for licensing reasons.
